# Homework-6: Thermal Energy Balance

## Suggested Due Date: Before midnight on Wednesday, December 9.

While there are several model files that you will need to read and undestand in order to successfully complete this assignment, there are only two files where you need to make changes:

1. `Homework-6.ipynb`. The Jupyter notebook describes the assignmen in great detail.  After completing #2 (below), you will run the code blocks (you should not change any code in the notebook!) and then add discussion to the relevant markdown blocks (these are highlighted in red text).
2. `battery_spm_function.py`.  You will add several lines of code to calculate thermal source/sink terms so that you can calcualte dT/dt for the three battery components (anode, elecrolyte separator, cathode).  Each spot where changes are required is marked with ` YOUR CODE GOES HERE`.  It should be about 21 lines of code, in total.
